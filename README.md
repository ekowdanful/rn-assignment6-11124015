Design Choices
- The application consists of two main screens: HomeScreen and CartScreen.
- The HomeScreen displays a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each item.
- The CartScreen displays the items added to the cart with a "Remove from Cart" button for each item.
- Used React Navigation for screen navigation.

## Data Storage
- Utilized AsyncStorage for local data storage to persist the cart items between app sessions.
